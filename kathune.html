<p><b>Q1. What is Kathune?</b></p>

<p>Kathune is the spidering engine used by WoW Lemmings to parse guild recruitment data from public forums and consolidate it into a single stream of data, which is
then used to populate the WoW Lemmings site and rss feeds.</p>	

<a name="q2"></a>
<p><b>Q2. How does Kathune know about my site?</b></p>

<p>Presently, there is a pre-set list of websites that Kathune knows about and spiders on a semi-regular basis, such as the Blizzard WoW Alliance and Horde recruitment forums,
along with the Blizzard Europe WoW recruitment forums. Unlike classic web-spiders for search engines like Google or Yahoo!, Kathune is not smart enough to find new
 sites; it only reads guild recruitment posts from the sites it is told to, by the developer of WoW Lemmings.</p>

<a name="q3"></a>
<p><b>Q3. Can I tell Kathune not to read our data?</b></p>

<p>Currently, you will have to send an email to shawn.a.holmes 'at' gmail.com in order to have your site removed. Future support to acknowledge/respect the Robots.txt file
will work.</p>

<a name="q4"></a>
<p><b>Q4. Where did you get that name?</b></p>

<p>Kathune is the phonetic spelling and proper pronounciation 
of <strong><a onClick="javascript:urchinTracker('http://www.wowwiki.com/C%27Thun');" href="http://www.wowwiki.com/C%27Thun" target="_blank">C'thun</a></strong>, one of the
 Old Gods in World of Warcraft lore, as well as the final raid boss of The Temple of Ahn'Qiraj.</p>
 
 <a name="q5"></a>
<p><b>Q5. What information may I use to identify Kathune as a robot on my forums?</b></p>

<p>You may identify Kathune by the following information:
<ul>
<li><strong>Agent (USER_AGENT):</strong> Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; WoW Lemmings Kathune/2.0; http://www.wowlemmings.com/kathune.html)</li>
<li><strong>Source IP Address:</strong> 76.12.83.244</li>
</ul>
