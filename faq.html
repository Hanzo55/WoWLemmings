<p><b>Q1. What is WoW Lemmings?</b></p>

<p>WoW Lemmings is a web-based tool that helps guild leaders and recruiters search for new World of Warcraft players. It does this by being a
repository for player postings, categorizing them, and offering an easy-to-use filtering interface to quickly narrow down the specific type of
player one might search for.</p>	

<a name="q2"></a>
<p><b>Q2. Where does WoW Lemmings collect its data from?</b></p>

<p>WoW Lemmings is powered by <a href="kathune.html">Kathune</a>, a proprietary spidering robot hand-tailored to scan popular WoW fan sites and
forums, searching for posts that identify themselves as players looking for guilds. Currently, Kathune scans a total of 32 individual URLs across
the following sites:

<p><b>Q3. What kind of information does WoW Lemmings look for?</b></p>

<p>WoW Lemmings reads the guild recruitment forums, looking for keywords and phrases in the title of a forum post that might indicate whether or not
the post describes a person looking for a guild. More often than not, this is simply the case of the "LF Guild" phrase (or variations) detected in the title.</p>

<a name="q4"></a>
<p><b>Q4. How can I ensure my post gets listed on WoW Lemmings?</b></p>

<p>You shouldn't have to do any additional work beyond your standard post to the a WoW fansite's Guild Recruitment forums. Once posted, WoW Lemmings will find
the post and, provided you used an accurate title to describe that you are currently looking for a new guild, index your listing into its database. Then, as people
visit WoW Lemmings, your listing will show up.</p>

<a name="q5"></a>
<p><b>Q5. Are there any tips on improving my post?</b></p>

<p>Absolutely. Here are a few tips:
	<ul>
		<li>Be sure to identify your faction (Alliance or Horde), server-type (PvE or PvP), and class in your post title.</li>
		<li>Use parenthetical-style symbols to enclose your faction and server-type, which is common on the WoW Forums. For example:<br/><br/>
			<font style="font-family:Courier;"><b>[H-PvP] Destro Lock LF Guild / Has Vashj Vial</b></font><br/><br/>
			is a good example of using the [ and ] symbols to enclose your faction and server-type. WoW Lemmings will look for similar braces, such as (), and {}.
		</li>
		<li>Pay close attention to spelling, <font style="color:red;">typos may cost you!</font></li>
		<li>In the body of your post, keep your description short and succinct. WoW Lemmings will only display about 400 characters in the "balloon" that pops-up over your
		post title, so keep the most important information at the start. Introduce yourself, describe your class/spec/gear, and what you are looking for in a new home.</li>
		<li>Add a link to the Armory in the body of your post; it will get picked up by WoW Lemmings, and helps guild recruiters examine your info quickly.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Q6. My listing disappears when I turn on the Idiot Filter. Why was I classified as an idiot?</b></p>

<p>99% of the time, this is due to you misspelling a common WoW-related term, or using l33t-speak to describe your post. If you are a Rogue,
don't list yourself as a <font style="color:red;">ROUGE</font>. If you are a Druid, don't list yourself as a <font style="color:red;">DROOD</font>. WoW Lemmings may know about these terms and will still classify
your character properly, but that doesn't mean it won't think you're an idiot as well. Your posting should read like a resume, and should be spell-checked
appropriately. For some guilds, <em>this is important.</em>. If you feel you were mis-classified as an idiot, <a href="contact.html">send me an email</a>, along with your forum post.</p>

<a name="q7"></a>
<p><b>Q7. I don't want my current guild to know I'm looking for a new home. Will you "out" me?</b></p>

<p>If you wish to stay anonymous, just leave your character name out of your post, and don't put a link in to your armory listing. WoW Lemmings will never
index the Armory link attached to your forum-avatar, so posting on an alt is perfectly fine to stay secretive.</p>

<a name="q8"></a>
<p><b>Q8. Why would I want to use the RSS feed?</b></p>

<p>The RSS feed is for guild recruiters that would like to keep getting updates on a very specific profile. For example, if you are a guild
recruiter, and you are currently looking for new Priests on a PvP realm, and you are in North America, you can choose the "US" region filter,
the "Priest" class filter, and the "PvP" server filter, to generate a listing of just that resultset. Then, if you don't find what you are looking for,
you can subscribe to the RSS feed assigned to that search by clicking on the little "Subscribe" link on the left-hand side of the page, near the RSS icon 
(a little orange box). Once subscribed, as new Priests on PvP servers in North America make posts, the RSS feed will automatically pick them up, and send 
updates directly to recruiters that have subscribed. The RSS feeds are provided simply to give you one less thing to worry about.</p>

<a name="q9"></a>
<p><b>Q9. I'm looking for a new guild. How do I use WoW Lemmings to search for guilds?</b></p>

<p>WoW Lemmings was built to act as a tool for guild leaders and recruiters, who struggle daily with finding new people. It does not support the
ability to index, list, or provide advertisements for other guilds that are looking for people. This functionality belongs in another tool, and is
not planned to be supported.</p>
